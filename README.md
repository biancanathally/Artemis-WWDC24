# Artemis
### [Accepted] 🏆 WWDC24 Swift Student Challenge 

Artemis was my submission to the 2024 [Swift Student Challenge](https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/). In 2024, applicants were tasked with creating an interactive app playground on the topic of their choice to showcase their passion for coding.

## About project 🚀🌓
This project takes the player on an exciting journey towards lunar exploration, specifically the Artemis III mission scheduled for 2026. Accompanied by Luna, the guide in this experience, the player has the opportunity to actively engage and gain insight into the mission. Before commencing, information about the crew and mission context is provided. In an immersive experience, in the first part, the rocket is assembled piece by piece, experiencing the preparation process for launch. Then, the player will board the SLS rocket, witnessing the ejection of parts and the journey towards the Moon, where only the Orion spacecraft will remain.
